## Check-in System
Users can use a tablet or computer to check-in students. The system will handle the attendance and the records will be used to notify the user when it's time to promote their students. Users can create their own ranking system and assign the number of required days for the next promotion to each level.

Users can give attendance credit when students attend a certain event like a competition or movie night. The given credit will be added to students' attendance records to be used in promotion.

## Promotion
It is recommended to use a tablet to have the promotion list and test each student and give them a promotion easily.
Don't miss the promotion day as any student who took classes hard deserves that.
